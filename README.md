MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

MVP

Be a working, interactive React app, built using create react app.
Utilize React Router, installed via NPM.
Have at least 6 separate, rendered components.
Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
Use Axios to consume data from Airtable, and GET/render that data in your components.
Use Axios to POST/create new data on Airtable.
Use only React for DOM Manipulation.


Display global, cumulative, COVID statistics 
Include a user submission box where they may enter symptoms they may be experiencing to inform of possible local outbreaks.


PostMVP

When a user submits symptoms related to COVID, a warning message displays regarding a possible local outbreak.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:
Fortunate to have found a reliable API that supplies great data.  

Weaknesses:
I feel that I might struggle with incorporating AirTable into the project.

Opportunities:
If time and skill allows, I'd like to display a warning message on the app if a COVID outbreak is occuring locally.

Threats:
Time.
